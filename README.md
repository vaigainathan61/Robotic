ðŸ¤– Robotics Project with Facial Emotion Detection

This repository highlights my robotics project, which focuses on designing, developing, and demonstrating a functional robot prototype integrated with real-time facial emotion recognition. The robotic system combines hardware components such as sensors, motors, and controllers with intelligent programming to perform automated tasks efficiently. The uploaded images showcase the robotâ€™s structure, wiring connections, and component layout.

The main goal of this project is to explore automation principles and human-robot interaction. By integrating electronic hardware with Python or embedded programming, the robot can detect its environment, respond to input commands, and perform actions like movement, obstacle detection, object handling, and context-aware gestures. Additionally, the system uses a webcam with DeepFace and OpenCV to identify human facial expressions such as happy, sad, surprised, angry, fearful, disgusted, and neutral, enabling the robot to react appropriately to different emotional cues.

This project emphasizes the importance of control systems, mechanical design, signal interfacing, and AI integration. It serves as a learning platform for robotics and AI enthusiasts who want to understand the process of designing, assembling, and programming a robot capable of interacting intelligently with humans.

The repository includes:

Arduino Mega code for servo-controlled robotic hand movements and gestures.

Python code for real-time facial emotion detection.

Instructions for setting up the system, connecting the robotic hardware with AI software, and running demonstrations.

References, circuit diagrams, images, and code snippets to help others understand the development process.

This project demonstrates innovation, creativity, and technical knowledge in robotics and artificial intelligence, showcasing how robots can not only perform physical tasks but also perceive and respond to human emotions, paving the way for more interactive and intelligent robotic systems.
